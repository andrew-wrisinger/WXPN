1. How can I loop the script to search all dates?

  -- Currently only able to use a hard-coded date.
  
2. How can I RegEx to grab only the date, air time, artist name, song title, and album title?

  -- Song links have the following structure:
    ** /utils/playlist/accordionplaylistfdatavjoom.php?q=Artist+Artist^Song+Song+Song^Album+Album^260
    ** Carets delimit the artist, song and album info.
    
3. How can I format the parsed data to a schema?

  -- Date, air time, artist name, song title, album title.

4. Where will I store this data?


5. What features would I want to build upon this dataset?

  -- Search
